# RetrieveAI

RetrieveAI is a scoped-first AI Retrieval Intelligence Engine designed to measure how generative AI systems retrieve, represent, and reason about a brand.

Unlike SEO tools that measure ranking, RetrieveAI measures inclusion inside LLM inference — using deterministic prompt simulation, entity reinforcement modeling, and scope-aware scoring architecture.

## Core Principles

- Scoped-first audits (single_page → context_cluster → category → full_site)
- Deterministic LLM dispatch (temperature=0)
- Postgres-based concurrency control
- Defensive engineering patterns (circuit breakers, idempotency, timeout budgets)
- Retrieval ≠ Ranking
